## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Favorite Applications

Forscore:
  - The speed in which I can navigate through large files
  - The options for organization that I can use to store and search through my files
  - Proven reliability that makes me feel comfortable using it in performance settings 

Waze:
  - Intuitive user interface
  - Gamefied navigation that is fun with someone else in the car
  - Great integration with Apple Carplay so I can drive without distraction

YouTube:
  - Video autoplay so I can decide whether I want to spend time watching the video or not before clicking on it
  - Picture-in-picture playback
  - Ease of use in switching accounts

## App Idea

I would like to work on an app that holds PDFs of sheet music like Forscore, but with a larger emphasis on musicians' practice tools. 
This would include an advanced metronome, recording options, and more. Currently, musicians need to use multiple apps for all this functionality,
but this app would bring everything together.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
